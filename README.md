# youtube-android-sdk

### This is a wrapper over the official [YouTube Android Player API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/android/player/downloads/) library. It helps you to add it as a dependency without copy-paste a .jar file, but with two lines of code in your gradle files.

#### To use it in your android project
1. [Add the jitpack.io repository](https://jitpack.io/docs/ANDROID/#installing) in your project level build.gradle file
2. Add this dependency in your application level build.gradle file
    ```gradle
    dependencies {
      compile 'com.github.NikolaBorislavovHristov:youtube-android-sdk:1.2.2'
    }
    ```
